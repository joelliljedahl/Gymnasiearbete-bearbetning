                            !!DISCLAIMER!! WNDD Solutions does not exist, it's a made up company, that is part of a school project. The company is only here to give this website design a more complete look, everything said about the company on this website is also made up and that includes the websites  we claim we have done, which we haven't. We do not own the right to anything except the website's empty shell and the illustrations shown.
